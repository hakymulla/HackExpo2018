Use Deep Learning to tell the state of road traffic

#The Problem

In modern cities, road traffic congestion and accidents have both led to loss of valuable times and lives and has become a severe problem for cities. Automated Traffic Control systems can alleviate the hazards of road congestion and accidents by providing real-time statistics about the state of the road. This systems can potentially save lives by autonomously reporting Accidents and Fire Incidents on the road the moment they occur. Thanks to recent advances in Deep Learning, such traffic control and road safety systems are now possible.

The Challenge
DeepQuestAI in partnership with AI Saturdays Lagos has collected 4000 pictures of four different traffic states representing the following:

    Sparse Traffic
    Dense Traffic
    Accident
    Vehicle on Fire
